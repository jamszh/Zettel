# Zettel

== Zettel ==

Some random notes on random things that are okay to have public because I'm a (穷鬼) povo and don't want to pay for Github pro.

== Why? ==
- I need a notetaking app that can sync to mobile
- Leverage github wiki and git for versioning
- Markdown rendering for freeeee babyyyy
- Vimwiki because why not
